During my internship at Codsoft, I gained valuable experience in Java development and honed my skills in several key areas. I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects that involved designing, implementing, and debugging Java applications, which deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming and software design principles. I became proficient in using frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate, and I improved my ability to write clean, efficient code while collaborating with a team of experienced developers. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities and my capacity to adapt to evolving project requirements.
